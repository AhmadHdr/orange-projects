# Orange Projects

## Intro
Orange is an excellent tool for practicing Machine Learning (ML)
and simulating models to enhance understanding of how they work.
It is also open-source, making it available for use on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### How to Download Orange Data Mining
From my experience, I am using 2 ways for downloading this tools,
1. Download directly from the [Official Orange Data Mining Website](https://orangedatamining.com/download/)
2. Download via Anaconda Navigator. You can download Anaconda Navigator from this 
[Anaconda Navigator](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success)

### How to Start a Project with Orange Data Mining
1. Launch the Orange Data Mining application.
2. From the `Data` navigation panel, click or drag `Datasets` onto the canvas.
3. Select an existing dataset from the list.
4. Click or drag `Data Table` onto the canvas.
5. Connect the `Datasets` widget to the `Data Table` widget to display the data.
6. From the `Model` navigation panel, click or drag the model you want to use onto the canvas.
7. From the `Visualize` navigation panel, click or drag the visualization tool you prefer onto the canvas.
8. Connect the `Datasets` widget to the `Model` widget you have chosen.
9. Connect the `Model` widget to the visualization tool to display the results.



With these steps, you can easily set up and explore machine learning models using Orange Data Mining.
